## Basic information

- Project name: VineStar üç∑.
- Platform/protocol: Polkadot & Astar Network.
- Project initiation date: November 1, 2023.

## Project Overview

VineStar is a decentralized application that enables financing, buying, and selling the finest quality Chilean wine. It's a platform that directly connects vineyards with end consumers. VineStar allows the purchase of NFTs representing physical wine bottles that can be sold in our secondary market upon production or delivered to your doorstep for enjoying our excellent wine. Lastly, you'll have the opportunity to acquire unique wine collections focused on blockchain and web3, released each season.

#### Project Background

Chilean wine stands among the world's best. Major and renowned vineyards in the country are significant exporters, notably to the Asian region, particularly Japan. However, upon market analysis, we encounter three critical issues:

1. Wine distributors sell at high prices, hindering vineyards from reaching diverse audiences.
2. There's often limited support for wine producers, constraining their fundraising rounds.
3. End consumers face high prices and lack the option to buy exclusivity.

Hence, we plan to create: VineStar üç∑.

This solution aims not only to eliminate these mentioned limitations but also to facilitate vineyards and their brands' expansion. It will support wine production even in its early stages and enable users to obtain good prices for excellent-quality wines, with the option of home delivery, ready to enjoy.

#### Project Features

The main features of this project are:

1. Funding opportunities for wine production.
2. Earning rewards from obtaining the NFT (which, upon maturation, can be sold at a higher price than purchased).
3. Lower costs for the end-user.
4. Ability to buy and sell in a secondary market.
5. Obtaining a membership for discounts and gifts.
6. Purchase of exclusive crypto collections.

These are the primary features that make our application a true star.

#### Project Value

1. Direct Support to Vineyards: Through this business model, we aim to directly support vineyards in their production and distribution, enabling users to buy at a lower cost and providing opportunities for financing the process.

2. Authentication and Validity: We'll utilize blockchain for data veracity; purchasing an NFT will record your ownership and control of a digital asset representing a real-world asset.

3. Reputation System: Better wines, delivery times, and vineyard sales will clearly reflect their reputation within the community, demonstrating reliability and commitment.

4. Scalability with Ease: Being on Polkadot and Astar Network leverages advantages in connectivity and network interoperability, allowing future inclusion of new tokens and collections from different networks to expand our market.

5. Pioneering App in Our Category: This grants us significant value, being among the first apps offering this product on blockchain, differentiated from others, making us the best in class.
