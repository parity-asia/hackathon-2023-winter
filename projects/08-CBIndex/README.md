## Basic Information

**Project Name:** CBIndex

**Project Initiation Date:** 2023-11-15

**Track:** DApp & Smart Contract

## Important Note

The Project CBIndex attended Polkadot Hackathon Summer 2023. At that time, we tried to complete the copy-investing feature for the copy fund (the basic feature of our project), and tried to deploy on the Vara blockchain. Due to the lack of maturity of the infra and time constraints, we barely finished the copy-investing feature during the hackathon.

We were very lucky to win the 3rd place of the smart contract track.

This time, we've done sufficient research and planning. We would love to try completing one of our advanced features, namely active on-chain funds, on Moonbase Alpha TestNet.

## Project Overview

### Background

CBIndex is an ongoing project that aims to provide a comprehensive suite of on-chain investment and crypto asset management tools. The project is structured as a dual-component platform, comprising the "CBIndex Simulator" and the "CBIndex DApp." This unique architecture allows CBIndex to offer a wide array of features that cater to a diverse range of user needs and preferences.

### Origin

The origin of CBIndex is deeply rooted in the core principles of traditional finance, particularly in the concept of mutual funds, which have long been a cornerstone of effective asset management. In the traditional finance market, mutual funds represent a proven model for pooling investments, managed by experts or indices to achieve a diversified and optimized portfolio. This model of collective investment and professional management has been a game-changer in democratizing access to sophisticated investment strategies for a broad range of investors.

Translating this time-tested approach to the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency, CBIndex was conceived to harness the power of on-chain funds. The platform is designed to facilitate crypto asset management by leveraging the transparency, security, and efficiency inherent in blockchain technology. The parallel here is striking: just as mutual funds revolutionized traditional asset management by offering diversification and expert management, CBIndex aims to transform crypto asset management by providing a platform for on-chain funds that simplifies and enhances investment strategies in the crypto space.

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄ **What is CBIndex**

As a crypto asset management platform using on-chain funds, CBIndex provides various crypto investment tools built on the CBI protocol, fostering an innovative environment for individuals and entities to manage and grow their crypto assets.

CBIndex is structured as a dual-component platform, comprising the "CBIndex Simulator" and the "CBIndex DApp." This unique architecture allows CBIndex to offer a comprehensive suite of features that cater to a wide range of user needs and preferences.

In the CBIndex ecosystem, the Simulator and the DApp components operate on distinct financial frameworks to cater to varying user needs and risk profiles. Within the Simulator, all investment activities are conducted using simulated USDT (sUSDT), which mirrors the real-time prices of crypto assets. This allows users to engage in a wide array of investment strategies without any financial risk, offering a sandbox environment for experimentation and learning. Conversely, the DApp component facilitates real investments, where users deploy actual crypto assets such as USDT to engage in actual financial transactions. This bifurcated approach ensures that while the Simulator serves as a risk-free educational platform, the DApp offers a real-world investment experience, each aligning with CBIndex's overarching goal of comprehensive and flexible on-chain investment and crypto asset management.

üåà **What problem do we want to solve**

The problem is most crypto investors make bad investment decisions.

üßô **How do we solve the problem**

We deliver a solution built with on-chain funds.

- Copy fund & active fund: copy-investing and mutual investing to bridge seasoned and new investors.
- Index fund: easy access to diversified crypto asset investments.
- Simulator: equip each user with a powerful investment simulator to play with.

### Project Features

- **On-chain fund creation and management (will be completed during the Hackathon)**
- **Active fund investment (will be completed during the Hackathon)**
- Copy fund investment
- Index fund investment
- Investment strategy
- Fund performance tracking & analysis
- Versatile AI agent

### Project Value

Provide a better solution of making crypto asset investment, especially for new investors. On-chain fund is a new type of DeFi product, which has been proven to be effective in the traditional financial market. We believe that on-chain fund will be a new trend in the crypto market.

### Technical Architecture

The technical architecture of CBIndex serves as the bedrock upon which the platform's diverse functionalities and features are built. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture, underlying technologies, and technical considerations that empower both the Simulator and the DApp components of CBIndex.
By delving into the intricacies of our technical infrastructure, we seek to offer readers a transparent and in-depth understanding of how CBIndex operates, ensuring that it aligns with industry best practices and meets the highest standards of security, scalability, and performance. Whether you are a potential investor, a developer, or an end-user, this chapter is designed to elucidate the technical robustness that makes CBIndex a pioneering solution in the realm of on-chain investment and crypto asset management.

The architecture of CBIndex is meticulously designed to offer a harmonious blend of centralized and decentralized components, encapsulated within the Simulator and the DApp, respectively. This dual-architecture approach serves multiple purposes. First, it provides an educational, playful, and risk-free environment through the Simulator, allowing users to familiarize themselves with on-chain investment and crypto asset management without financial exposure.

Second, it offers a decentralized, secure, and transparent platform through the DApp, aligning with the ethos of blockchain and catering to users who are ready for real investments.

The three-layered structure‚ÄîInfrastructure, Core, and Application‚Äîensures modularity and scalability, allowing each component to evolve independently while maintaining overall system integrity. Additionally, the "Integration" part signifies CBIndex's commitment to adaptability and innovation, as it leaves room for incorporating essential services and emerging technologies to meet evolving market demands.
The architecture diagram of CBIndex, as shown in Figure 2, offers a holistic view of the technical structure, divided into three primary layers: Infrastructure, Core, and Application. Each layer has specific components for both the Simulator and the DApp, and an additional part on the right outlines various integrations that enhance the platform's capabilities.
