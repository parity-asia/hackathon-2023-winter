## Basic Information

**Project Name:** CBIndex

**Project Initiation Date:** 2023-11-15

## Important Note 
CBIndex attended Polkadot Hackathon Summer 2023. At that time, we tried to complete copy-investing feature for copy fund (the basic feature of our platform), and worked on Vara blockchain. Due to the lack of maturity of the infra and time constraints, we barely finished the copy-investing feature. We were very lucky and won the 3rd place of the smart contract track.

This time, we've done sufficient research and planning. We would love to try completing our advanced feature, namely active on-chain funds, on Moonriver. 

One of the reasons we choose Moonriver is beacuse that CBIndex requires the price feed service of Chainlink, and Chainlink supports Moonriver.

## Project Overview

#### Project Background
As a crypto asset management platform using on-chain funds, CBIndex provides various crypto investment tools built on the CBI protocol, fostering an innovative environment for individuals and entities to manage and grow their crypto assets.

CBIndex is structured as a dual-component platform, comprising the "CBIndex Simulator" and the "CBIndex DApp." This unique architecture allows CBIndex to offer a comprehensive suite of features that cater to a wide range of user needs and preferences.

In the CBIndex ecosystem, the Simulator and the DApp components operate on distinct financial frameworks to cater to varying user needs and risk profiles. Within the Simulator, all investment activities are conducted using simulated USDT (sUSDT), which mirrors the real-time prices of crypto assets. This allows users to engage in a wide array of investment strategies without any financial risk, offering a sandbox environment for experimentation and learning. Conversely, the DApp component facilitates real investments, where users deploy actual crypto assets such as USDT to engage in actual financial transactions. This bifurcated approach ensures that while the Simulator serves as a risk-free educational platform, the DApp offers a real-world investment experience, each aligning with CBIndex's overarching goal of comprehensive and flexible on-chain investment and crypto asset management.
