+ DOT, ACA, GLMR, ASTR & AZERO depositing & rewarding

+ Aleph Zero & Moonbeam & Astar NFT distribution.

### Problem
Event organization demands are relatively high. In particular, there are approximately **1.8 million events and meetings held per year** in the United States (US - largest event organizers in the world).

However, Hosting an event requires several steps and tools. For example, the organizers need to use platforms like `Eventbrite`, Mailchimp, Facebook Event, or Luma to create event listings, sell tickets, and send invitation letters. Additionally, they need to utilize platforms such as Gleam to create social quests, like following someone on Twitter or joining Discord or Telegram. For interactive elements, organizers may employ tools like Kahoot for quiz games or random Lucky Draw Web Apps. They could use a random QR Code app as well, which might stop working or force users to watch an ad after 20 scans without notice. Moreover, if the organizers want to distribute rewards like tokens to attendees, it must be done manually. Although 92% of marketers say event software helps them reach business goals. (Branka, 2023), fragmented tools or platforms takes them a lot of time and human resources.

Even if event organizers were pleased to use many tools or platforms at the same time, they would have to spend a lot of money on each of them. For instance, when it comes to event ticketing systems, `Eventbrite` is a popular choice for many. However, it's essential to consider the costs associated with Eventbrite's services. In the USA, they charge a 3.7% commission plus $1.79 per sold ticket, while in the UK, it's a 6.95% commission plus £0.59 per sold ticket.

In recent years, event sponsoring plays an important role in event organizing process for both event organizers and sponsors. It has been considered as an effective way to promote the company's brand. Sponsoring is a priority for 82% of marketers (Splash). While sponsors struggle in finding suitable events, many event organizers still face finance difficulties. 46.3% of event professionals consider the increased price of putting on events to be the biggest challenge they face (Knowland, 2022)

### Solutions
- `Our solution to this problem is to create an all-in-one event platform to support event organizers comprehensively`. Applying technology into organizing plays an important role, 68.7% of event professionals agree that using technology to improve the attendee experience is a trend with staying power (Knowland, 2022).

- Our existing platform has successfully supported some events with our basic functions including `Standard Ticketing`, `check-in by QR code`, `Users management`.

- In this Polkadot hackathon, we plan to develop some new features applied Aleph Zero & Polkadot blockchain including `NFT Generator (AZERO), NFT Claim (AZERO), Crowdsponsor (DOT, ASTR, AZERO)`. In adition, in first, second and third quarter of 2024, we will fulfill this platform as our roadmap to become a comprehensive event platform.



### Impact
In details, the benefits that Plats will bring to the Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network include:

Event platform with integration into the Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network:

- Plats will help save a lot of time and effort to organize a event by automatic tools • `Our previous MVP has successfully shown the capability of serving an event with over 10000 attendees`.

- `Onboard more Web 2 users to the Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network and more parachain`: • Billions of people are attending traditional events every day. With the capabilities of supporting both Web 2 and Web 3 events, Plats can reward DOT, ASTR & AZERO, as well as NFTs, directly to new users' wallets without a hassle. This would increase the number of new users and new wallets. DOT, ASTR & AZERO usage in Plats Events will increase liquidity, trading volume and use case for DOT, ASTR & AZERO

- `The use of DOT, ASTR & AZERO` as fuel for rewarding and sponsoring will increase the liquidity and trading volume as more participants engage within the platform.

Strengthening Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network in all over the world

- Plat's DOT, ASTR & AZERO CrowdSponsor allows anyone to sponsor an event from anywhere in the world, as long as it accepts DOT, ASTR & AZERO. Interested parties from developed countries could sponsor Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network events in developing countries, and vice versa. Positive Perception and Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network: • The integration of DOT, ASTR & AZERO as fuel of all the system enhances the perception and reputation of Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network. It showcases the platform's versatility and ability to be used in real-world applications, adding credibility to Polkadot Ecosystem & Aleph Zero network.
