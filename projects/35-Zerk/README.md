## Installation

To get started with Zerk, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/soft-law/zerk.git`
2. Navigate to the chain, frontend, or smart contracts directory: `cd xxxxxxxx`
3. Ensure to use the 20.10.0v of npm.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Follow the instructions of each readme included in each directory.

## Contributions

Is important to follow a series of steps to be organized between ourselves:

- Clone the repository
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/zrk-xx-new-feature` (Where xx is the ticket number in Jira)
- Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Little description of the changes'`
- Push to the branch: `git push -u origin feature/zrk-xx-new-feature`
- Submit a pull request adding a clear description and screenshots if it's necessary.
- Share the link of the PR in the GitHub channel on the Discord server.

Please adhere to code style guidelines (Install Prettier to ensure this) and ever run `git pull origin main` before the creation of the PR and later push the changes again to skip conflicts with other developers.

### And please, never push directly into the main branch by skipping the PR and code review!
