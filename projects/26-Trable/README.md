## Basic Info

### Project Name
Trable

### Date of project initiation:

2023/12/02

## Origin

This project was initiated by Yanbo, the initiator of the project. 

During his participation in Token2049 in September 2023, when he used crypto to pay for air tickets and hotels from mainland China to Singapore, he encountered problems such as **cumbersome time and steps, and large wear and tear on funds**.

During this period, he learned about Polkadot’s series of cross-chain ecology at the Polkadot booth of Token2049 and came up with the idea of building a set of crypto tourism products on the Polkadot ecosystem that are low-loss, fast and efficient and simplify consumer payment steps. 

Therefore, in this winter hackathon, we tried to make a solution to the trable project.

## Introduction

With the growing Web3 ecosystem, more and more people are entering the Web3 industry, leading to an increasing number of individuals using cryptocurrencies for payments of products and services. However, the process of completing a purchase has become cumbersome, especially when it involves overseas products, requiring multiple asset conversions. This process is time-consuming and incurs high costs.

Traditional crypto payment process for overseas travel products:

    Cryptocurrency - DEX - CEX - Fiat currency - Foreign fiat currency payment

  A3 -->|Asset Replacement| B -->|gas consumption<br>Waiting for the payment to be credited.| C3 -->|Asset Transfer| D -->|Rate Discount| D1 --> E
  E --> |Currency Conversion Fee| F
```


### Drawbacks:
- ❌ DEX conversion friction costs
- ❌ CEX transaction fees
- ❌ Currency conversion loss during withdrawal
- ❌ Currency conversion fees for foreign money payments


Trable's Objective:
- ✅ One-step signing, minimal fees

To address these challenges, our project proposes a solution that optimizes the asset conversion process and enhances users' Web3 experience. In the post-pandemic era, the travel industry is thriving, and Trable aims to enter this vast market by offering unique value propositions.


## Acala asset router technical analysis

We aim to help users who want to pay their travel fee directly through polka related asset like DOT. Thus transfering polka asset from parachain to USDC on EVM is our primary target. 

We utilize acala asset router to achieve the target. The following 6 steps describe how it works in detail.




### Project Introduction

Trable is an overseas travel product Dapp application for cryptocurrency payment.

This application integrates Uniswap V4 and other technologies and relies on the Acala and Moonbean platforms in the Polkadot ecosystem to effectively simplify the process for users to order overseas travel products using cryptocurrency, shorten the time required for consumers and reduce the cost of DEX/CEX currency conversion. .

Users only need to select the required payment password and complete the signature to easily book overseas travel products on this Dapp. We have solved the problems of personal foreign exchange limit limits and insufficient payment tools, and provided necessary legal currency payment support. At the same time, we monitor the flow of funds in real time on the chain to ensure the safety of funds. During the entire process, only one handling fee will be charged, providing comprehensive protection for users’ ordering experience.
