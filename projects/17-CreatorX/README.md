## 基本资料

项目名称：CreatorX

项目立项日期 (哪年哪月)：2023/10


## Background

First, we create the RWA-Wallet.com, it's a wallet platform.
We make a browser extension that can make your twitter account into a NFT also attended the Polkadot Summer Hackathon.

Then Friend.tech comes out, then we realize that we can create a new module on Web only, that's why we start the `CreatorX` module after 2023/10.

The browser extension will be use after we gain 100k user on the web platform.
Now we focus on building the `Web only` feature of the `CreatorX`.

## Introduction

We build a blockchain base of X.com, all the new tweets require user to pay gas and ERC20 tokens to post. User can log in via an X.com account and our system use the MPC wallet tech to create a new wallet for the user under the hood. So users do not need to import any private key on our platform but still have a wallet to interact with blockchain.
