web3-plugin-polkadot
===========
This is a web3.js plugin for communicating with Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate nodes.

## Introduction
As web3.js v4.x supports plugins, this library will utilize that to build a plugin for Polkadot RPC providers. This plugin would allow users to execute calls like web3.substrate.namespace.RPC and similar commands for Polkadot RPCs. And later it would offer the additional functionalities related to accounts & contracts that differ from Ethereum.

## Why to build
There are 3 key benefits of this approach:

### Development experience and learning curve
Developers who already use web3.js would quickly start working with Polkadot and Substrate with fewer things to read and learn. All they need to do is provide the web3.js library with a link to a Polkadot, Kusama, or a Substrate provider, register the new plugin, and then start working just like they used to. There will be slight differences that they'll have to adjust for. And a good progressive effort would be spent to reduce the differences to the minimum.

### Code portability
Code that already exists for Ethereum DApps that uses web3.js, could be relatively-easily adapted to work with Polkadot and Substrate. Users would only have to make a few changes to their current code. For example, the code used to catch exceptions that indicate an unresponsive provider won't need to be changed. This also means developers may use the same code base for both Ethereum-based networks and Substrate, with just a bit of custom handling.

### Diversity
It is good to provide the developers with an additional alternative to polkadot{.js}. So, developers can pick the library that they feel more comfortable working with.

## Methodology

This plugin uses web3.js processing and logic; But, with the types from `@polkadot/types` in addition to types generated by `@polkadot/typegen`. Using those types keeps things smooth when communicating with RPC endpoints. In addition to keeping the available documentation available for those types mostly useful, instead of inventing new types for the non-EVM-compatible functionalities and endpoints. 
On the other hand, having the execution inside web3.js allows for having the benefits listed above in [Why to build](#why-to-build) section.  


## Sample plugin usage by the users

    Note: The code is still under development. However, below would give a clue on how it is intended to be used.

At your typescript project run:
`yarn add web3 @conx3/web3-plugin-polkadot`

After that,  use the following code to check the plugin:
```ts
import { Web3 } from 'web3';
import { PolkadotPlugin } from '@conx3/web3-plugin-polkadot';

async function main() {
  const web3 = new Web3("ws://127.0.0.1:9944/");
  web3.registerPlugin(new PolkadotPlugin());

  const hash = "0x7d4ef171d483d37aa2339877524f0731af98e367c38f8fa27f133193ed2b5615";
  const response = await web3.polkadot.chain.getBlock(hash);

  console.log('stateRoot:', response.block.header.stateRoot);
  // stateRoot: 0xa18402bc3a2249d6af8e2ad6241e5b1b60360abd1b4e2c7c733c8c980331d278

  
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
  // {
  //   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  //   "result": {
  //     "block": {
  //       "header": {
  //         "parentHash": "0x205d46cdcd9db4f795067718ef73292ab065aa08cec1ad6788b2c24028b160ea",

  //         "extrinsicsRoot": "0x345fc26b56a2a682a52ab5860b18df0a1698b0a6ac0cadd9bcba713d1a6f54d0",
  //         "digest": {
  //           "logs": [
  //             "0x0661757261203b5ee81000000000",
  //             "0x05617572610101187f7e10b05cd255b4ab0d3894b2c3c15bc4294a4124a7188981e3833af3440ae4322bec54ff65cb561e9fdfb4d02a5496fc64ea5991fcd4d42b43c48cd2588d"
  //           ]
  //         }
  //       },
  //       "extrinsics": [
  //         "0x280401000bd08620468c01"
  //       ]
  //     },
  //     "justifications": null
  //   },
  //   "id": 43
  // }
}
main();

```

Hints: Types were generated by following the steps at: https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/examples/promise/typegen/. And the edgeware.json file was generated from a local substrate dev node, version 14. That has been set up according to https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-rpc.
