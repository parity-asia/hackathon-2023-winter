# Basic Info

It is a web3 platform for patients to communicate with each other, providing a safe and comfortable forum for those with physical and mental illnesses to share experiences and seek help. We also use zk technology to verify access to the forum channel, ensuring that only those with specific illnesses can enter the corresponding channels for communication, thereby maintaining a safe and good communication environment.

# Project Details

### How it's Made
That's why we built Hippocratic Island, because now we have blockchain technology and zk technology. we can provide a secure and comfortable web 3.0 communication platform for patients with physical and mental illnesses through blockchain and zero-knowledge proof technology, and we also use SBT to verify access.
This is our process for authenticationï¼š
1. The patient receives the hospital's diagnosis information.
2. The patient sends the hash value of their address and disease information, and proof along with the hospital's signature, to the smart contract.
3. The smart contract verifies through zk whether the patient has a certain disease.
4. After confirmation, the corresponding SBT is issued to the patient's address.
5. After obtaining SBT, the users can enter the corresponding channel of the Hippocratic island for communication.
