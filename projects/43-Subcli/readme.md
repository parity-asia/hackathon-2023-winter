## Problem 

Due to complexity and insufficient documentation, beginners encountering Substrate have difficulties in the Rust programming language and the Substrate framework. Beside, building a Substrate Node involves numerous intricate manual steps from creating a new project, generating pallet's components, and modifying chain spec configurations,...

## Solution
Subcli emerges to automatically generate code for the Substrate Node Template, simplifying and expediting Substrate accessibility and development.


## Description
**Subcli is a powerful tool that simplifies Substrate development by automatically generating components for the FRAME within the Substrate Framework**. 
It offers two main functions: **automatic code generation** and **a low-code platform**.

The first function automatically generates code on the Substrate framework, making it easy for beginners to build chains with simple logic using just 2-3 lines of code. Instead of manual development, Subcli automatically generates code of all of Substrate components to the project.This also enables simplifying the development of large-scale projects and developers to focus solely on the project's business logic. Some tasks automated by Subcli include:

- Creating a new project
- Creating or renaming pallets.
- Generating components within pallets such asvarious storage types (value, map, etc.) along with creation, update, deletion functions; custom data types (struct); extrinsic, ..
- Other Substrate Components: chain spec,...
- Generating a full-stack Substrate + Frontend project template.

Based on the code generation tool, Subcli becomes a low-code platform by offering a store to buy pre-packaged components like NFT marketplace, DeFi applications, etc. This optimizes time and resources, allowing developers to purchase and integrate these components into projects without starting from scratch.

In summary, Subcli is a powerful tool that automates the creation of comprehensive Substrate code, facilitating swift accessibility and development for Substrate Nodes
