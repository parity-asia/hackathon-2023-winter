## Basic Information

Project Name: GOODORBAD

Project Initiation Date: November 15, 2023

## Project Overview

#### Project Background

Our daily lives are heavily reliant on consumption, and nobody wants to waste their money. Therefore, a company that develops a merchant review system has stepped forward, claiming to provide convenience for consumers and merchants. They aim to make good merchants well-known and enable consumers to easily find businesses that suit their needs. In other words, the purpose of the merchant review system is to provide valuable references for consumers' purchasing decisions.

However, some merchant review platforms have become bloated in their pursuit of rapid wealth accumulation and expansion. Eventually, they chose to betray their initial development motivations.

Summary: The maintenance costs and profit-driven behavior of merchant review platforms focused on high growth have caused operational issues. Their actions have become increasingly unsightly, ultimately resulting in the loss of value for the merchant review platform, turning it into an advertising and promotion platform.

To address these issues, we propose the project: GOODORBAD.

#### Project Features

This project has the following features:

1. Low maintenance and operating costs.
2. No advertisements.
3. Reputation systems for both merchants and consumers.
4. Profit generated through a registration system.

#### Project Value

1. Decentralized Operation: The project operates in a decentralized manner, without a central authority. User behavior is governed solely by predefined rules.
2. Registration System: Participants in the merchant review system are required to pledge a certain amount of funds to enter the platform. When merchants or consumers choose to leave the platform, they can retrieve their pledged funds.
3. Reputation Systems: Both merchants and consumers have their own reputation systems. Merchant reputation is determined by consumer reviews. Consumer reputation is evaluated based on merchant reviews, the number of reviews, and the richness of the content.
4. No Advertisements: Through detailed filtering, users can precisely find the merchants they are looking for, without being bombarded with targeted advertisements.
5. Scalable Functionality: The project can incorporate various additional features, such as reservation functionality, facial recognition payments, content moderation, and more.
